# Assignment 2 for October 25th 2022

The goal of this assignment is to implement some basic MPI applications.

## Exercise 1 (1 Point)

This exercise consists in writing a parallel application to speed up the computation of π.

### Description

There are many ways of approximating π, one being a well-known Monte Carlo method: The ratio of the areas of a square and its incircle is π/4. Since the exact area of a circle cannot be computed (we don't know the value of π yet), one can instead sample random points, check their distance from the center and compute the ratio of points inside the circle to all sampled points.

### Tasks

- Write a sequential application `pi_seq` in C or C++ that computes π for a given number of samples (command line argument). Test your application for various, large sample sizes to verify the correctness of your implementation.
- Consider a parallelization strategy using MPI. Which communication pattern(s) would you choose and why?
- Implement your chosen parallelization strategy as a second application `pi_mpi`. Run it with varying numbers of ranks and sample sizes and verify its correctness by comparing the output to `pi_seq`.
- Discuss the effects and implications of your parallelization.
- Insert the measured wall time for 10^9 samples for the sequential implementation and on 64 cores for MPI into the comparison spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E-9kRGMV8Py1Qp32wuVHs7dWSXIWigBHc3Ba1iTheFc/edit?usp=sharing

## Exercise 2 (2 Points)

This exercise consists in parallelizing an application simulating the propagation of heat.

### Description

A large class of scientific applications are so-called stencil applications. These simulate time-dependent physical processes such as the propagation of heat or pressure in a given medium. The core of the simulation operates on a grid and updates each cell with information from its neighbor cells.

### Tasks

- A sequential implementation of a 1-D heat stencil is available in [heat_stencil_1D_seq.c](heat_stencil_1D/heat_stencil_1D_seq.c). Read the code and make sure you understand what happens. See the Wikipedia article on [Stencil Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_code) for more information.
- Consider a parallelization strategy using MPI. Which communication pattern(s) would you choose and why? Are there additional changes required in the code beyond calling MPI functions? If so, elaborate!
- Implement your chosen parallelization strategy as a second application `heat_stencil_1D_mpi`. Run it with varying numbers of ranks and problem sizes and verify its correctness by comparing the output to `heat_stencil_1D_seq`.
- Discuss the effects and implications of your parallelization.
- Insert the measured wall time for N=4096 and 64 cores into the comparison spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E-9kRGMV8Py1Qp32wuVHs7dWSXIWigBHc3Ba1iTheFc/edit?usp=sharing
